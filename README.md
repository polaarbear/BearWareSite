This is a humourous website written from the ground up in solely HTML/CSS. This was a personal challenge to handle the task of making a site layout that works well on multiple screen sizes without needing JavaScript to dynamically scale the page.  The Gallery page hosts a pure HTML/CSS modal-style popup effect, and media files are playing using native HTML5 controls.  Other challenges were to maintain readability and visibility with a bold and uncommon color scheme, and to play around with CSS tags for things like text shadows, link coloration, and form building techniques.
